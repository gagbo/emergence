* What is this ?
This is a revisit of the [[https://github.com/gagbo/Flocking][Flocking project]]
I started in Qt. After playing with [[https://github.com/gagbo/flocking_sdl][SDL]], and
choosing that Qt is better for UI, I come back to Qt with the intent of making
a better architecture that will allow better maintainability.

The project is also quite "dirty" as I use this as a playground while
discovering design patterns and Qt possibilities. As such, for the time being
issues and PR I did not author will be ignored, and pushes will be made to
master until a working version of the project is reached

* Dependencies
  - Qt5

* How to play with it
The current CMake configuration overrides the default install location,
so there are no system implications about making the install target.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make install
./install/bin/emergence
#+END_SRC
